        Hi, I’m David Metzler—a mechanical engineering student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) with a passion for crafting innovative solutions at the intersection of robotics, AI, and sustainability. Originally from Mainz, Germany, I have always been driven by curiosity: whether it’s exploring the intricacies of automation systems or delving into philosophical questions about technology’s role in shaping society.

        Beyond academia, I’m a creator at heart. From designing a turtle-inspired robot that walks with only four servos to developing apps that merge OpenStreetMap with Wikipedia for a more interactive tourism experience, I’m constantly tinkering, learning, and experimenting.

        When I’m not deep in code or CAD models, you’ll find me scaling rock faces, cycling through scenic routes, or bouldering with friends. I’m also fascinated by the Himalayas and dream of visiting Asia to experience its cultures and landscapes. My goal? To engineer a future where technology and sustainability coexist harmoniously while staying true to the human spirit.
